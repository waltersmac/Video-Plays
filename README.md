# Video-Plays

### Initial Questions
How can I leverage that data structure to solve the problem I have been asked? 
What procedure can I think of if I have the start and end time of each video?
The data structure in question could be an array, a tuple, or a dictionary. If any one of these suits better to your algorithm, then you might just assume you will use that.
